# Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a full-stack web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input. It consists of:

Backend: A Flask API that processes input data and returns a prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model.

Frontend: An Angular application that provides a user interface for inputting data and displaying the prediction.
