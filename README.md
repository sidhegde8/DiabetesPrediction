# Diabetes Prediction App

Overview: The Diabetes Prediction App is a full-stack web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input. The project combines a machine learning model with a user-friendly interface to provide real-time predictions. The backend is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to process input data and generate predictions. The frontend, developed with Angular, offers an intuitive interface for users to input their health data and view the prediction results. The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability, making it suitable for cloud platforms like Google Cloud Run.

Motivations: I approached this project because of my passion for leveraging data science and AI to solve real-world problems, particularly in the healthcare domain. Diabetes is a widespread health issue, and early detection can significantly improve outcomes. By creating an accessible and user-friendly tool, I aim to empower individuals to assess their risk and take proactive steps toward better health. Furthermore, this project aligns with my career goals of developing impactful software solutions that integrate machine learning and web development, showcasing my ability to deliver end-to-end applications that are both functional and scalable.
